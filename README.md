Climb Master for GOEA

Basic Controls:

WASD: Character Movement
MOUSE: Camera Movement
SPACE: Jump/Double Jump/Climb

The basic mechanics of climbing require the player to be facing close to perpendicular to a wall face and holding
the SPACE key.

There is a limit on climbing stamina shown at the bottom of the screen that will deplete while climbing
and refill while not climbing.

The player is locked in the climbing state and cannot move horizontally away until they stop climbing.

Climbing can only be done while having upwards momentum and thus trying to climb while falling
will not work.

There exists a double jump that will be performed when the player is in the air during their first jump
and SPACE is pressed again.

This is my first project in Unreal and I am pretty proud of the amount I've been able to learn and do
in the couple of days that I've been using it. I appreciate the project set before me and if anyone
playing has some criticisms they would like to point out, I am more than welcome to hear them.
